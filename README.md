# Data Crunch Magic Würzburg
Repository containing the presentation used in the [Data Crunch Magic](https://ddojo.github.io/dcm.html) event in Würzburg.

I used the [Lemurs](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-08-24/readme.md) dataset provided by the [TidyTuesday project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) to illustrate:

+ data processing with packages from the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org)
+ code documentation with RMarkdown and the [minimal set up](https://github.com/ludmillafigueiredo/computational_notebooks) I propose for beginners
